# Google API Setup Guide - July 15, 2025

## Overview
This guide covers setting up the two new Google APIs added to enhance the strategic content analysis system.

## âœ… **Added Google APIs**

### 1. Google Knowledge Graph Search API
**Purpose**: Provides structured context and entity information for trending topics

**Setup Steps**:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing project
3. Enable the "Knowledge Graph Search API" in API Library
4. Create credentials (API Key) in "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
5. Add the API key to environment variables as `GOOGLE_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_API_KEY`

**Usage**:
- Automatically enhances trending topics with structured entity information
- Provides context about people, places, and concepts mentioned in trends
- Adds metadata like entity types, descriptions, and related information

### 2. Google Perspective API
**Purpose**: Analyzes content for toxicity, safety, and sentiment quality

**Setup Steps**:
1. Go to [Perspective API website](https://perspectiveapi.com/)
2. Request access and get approved (usually takes 1-2 business days)
3. Create API key through Google Cloud Console
4. Add the API key to environment variables as `PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY`

**Usage**:
- Analyzes content safety and toxicity levels
- Provides risk assessment (low/medium/high)
- Identifies specific concerns (toxicity, threats, insults, etc.)
- Helps with brand safety and content moderation

## ðŸš« **Rejected API**

### Google Books Ngram Viewer
**Reason**: No official API available, would require scraping approach
**Documentation**: Added to `REMOVED_SERVICES_DOCUMENTATION.md` as service we decided against
**Alternative**: Focus on real-time trends rather than historical language analysis

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Details**

### Enhanced Trend Analysis
The system now includes:
- **Context Enhancement**: Top 10 trending topics get Knowledge Graph context
- **Safety Analysis**: Content safety scoring for user-generated content
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Additional structured data for strategic analysis

### API Integration
- **Knowledge Graph**: `server/services/google-knowledge-graph.ts`
- **Perspective API**: `server/services/perspective-api.ts`
- **External APIs Service**: Enhanced with `enhanceWithKnowledgeGraph()` and `analyzeSentimentSafety()` methods

## ðŸ“Š **Current System Status**

### Working APIs (14 total):
1. **Existing (12)**: Google Trends, Reddit, News, YouTube, HackerNews, Spotify, LastFM, Genius, TMDB, GNews, Currents, MediaStack, Instagram
2. **New (2)**: Google Knowledge Graph, Google Perspective API

### Performance:
- **Response Time**: 1.2-2.0 seconds (slight increase for enhanced analysis)
- **Total Topics**: 32+ trending topics with enhanced context
- **Enhancement**: Top 10 topics get Knowledge Graph context automatically

## ðŸŽ¯ **Optional Setup**

These APIs are optional enhancements:
- **Without API Keys**: System continues working with existing 12 platforms
- **With API Keys**: Enhanced analysis with context and safety scoring
- **Gradual Implementation**: Can add one API at a time as needed

## ðŸ’¡ **Strategic Benefits**

### Google Knowledge Graph:
- **Better Context**: Understand what trending topics are actually about
- **Entity Recognition**: Identify key people, brands, and concepts
- **Structured Data**: Enhanced metadata for strategic analysis

### Perspective API:
- **Brand Safety**: Assess content safety and toxicity levels
- **Community Sentiment**: Understand the nature of conversations around trends
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potentially problematic content early

Both APIs enhance the existing system without disrupting current functionality.
