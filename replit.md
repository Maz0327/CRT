## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for the client application
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components for styling
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Axios** for API communication

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **Session-based authentication** with bcrypt for password hashing
- **PostgreSQL** database with Drizzle ORM

- **PostgreSQL** with comprehensive schema supporting:
  - Users and authentication
  - Content signals with status progression
  - Sources and external API tracking
  - Analytics and performance monitoring
  - Daily reports and briefings

## Key Components

### 1. Content Capture & Analysis Pipeline
- **Chrome Extension** for frictionless content capture from any webpage
- **Multi-platform trending data** aggregation (Google Trends, Reddit, YouTube, etc.)
- **AI-powered content analysis** using OpenAI for sentiment, themes, and strategic insights
- **Signal promotion workflow** from Capture â†’ Potential Signal â†’ Signal â†’ Insight

### 2. Strategic Dashboard Interface
- **Today's Briefing** - Curated daily insights from captured content
- **Explore Signals** - Unified interface for discovering and managing content signals
- **Strategic Brief Lab** - Tool for creating strategic briefs using the GETâ†’TOâ†’BY framework
- **Audience Insight Generator** - Cohort analysis and audience insights

### 3. External API Integration Layer
- **16+ integrated platforms** including Google Trends, Reddit, YouTube, Spotify, Instagram
- **Graceful fallback handling** for rate-limited APIs
- **Cost tracking** for external API usage
- **Performance monitoring** with detailed analytics

### 4. Authentication & Security
- **Session-based authentication** with secure cookie handling
- **Email/Username login** with case-insensitive username support
- **Password hashing** with bcrypt
- **Protected routes** with middleware validation
- **CORS configuration** for cross-origin requests

## Data Flow

1. **Content Capture**: Users capture content via Chrome extension or manual input
2. **AI Analysis**: Content is analyzed using OpenAI for strategic insights
3. **Signal Management**: Content progresses through status levels (Capture â†’ Potential Signal â†’ Signal â†’ Insight)
4. **Brief Creation**: Users synthesize signals into strategic briefs
5. **Export Options**: Briefs can be exported as markdown, HTML, or slide formats

## External Dependencies

### APIs & Services
