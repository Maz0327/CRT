Nice‚Äîseeing the UI on 3000 means the Vite/dev wiring is finally sane. üéØ

Want to keep momentum? Here‚Äôs the very next step (clean, ‚Äúcorrect way,‚Äù no hacks):

Step 28 ‚Äî Auth & Project-Scoping E2E (hardening + guardrails)

Goal

Make sure every UI request is authenticated, scoped to a project, and never explodes the UI when data is empty or malformed. This locks in reliability before we wire more features.

‚∏ª

Agent, do this (precise tasks)
	1.	Verify auth session in the browser

	‚Ä¢	Open the app at 3000 and confirm you‚Äôre logged in as the seeded test user (test@example.com / test123).
	‚Ä¢	If you see a login screen, log in once and continue.

	2.	Create a diagnostic ‚Äú/api/me‚Äù route (if not present)

	‚Ä¢	Add a tiny GET /api/me that returns { id, email } from the authenticated request context (Supabase JWT).
	‚Ä¢	Return 401 if unauthenticated.
	‚Ä¢	Log one line per request like: GET /api/me 200 in Xms :: {"id":"‚Ä¶","email":"‚Ä¶"}

	3.	Add a defensive Project header on the client

	‚Ä¢	In the single API helper used by UI v2 (the canonical one), ensure all API calls include X-Project-ID: <currentProjectId> when a project is selected.
	‚Ä¢	If no project is selected yet, omit the header and let the server default to the user‚Äôs last project or a safe ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù scope.

	4.	Confirm server-side project scoping

	‚Ä¢	Ensure the projectScope middleware:
	‚Ä¢	Reads X-Project-ID when provided, validates user access to that project.
	‚Ä¢	Falls back to a safe default project for that user if the header is missing.
	‚Ä¢	Responds with 403 {error:"project_access_denied"} if the user lacks access.
	‚Ä¢	Writes a concise log on each API call with the resolved project id.

	5.	Normalize the Projects API shape

	‚Ä¢	Ensure GET /api/projects returns an array (even if empty). No nested {rows: ‚Ä¶} or {data: ‚Ä¶} inconsistencies.
	‚Ä¢	Never return null‚Äîreturn [] instead.
	‚Ä¢	Add a server-side test (or quick curl) to confirm response is JSON array.

	6.	Add UI guards for Projects

	‚Ä¢	In ProjectSwitcher (and any place that touches projects), add defensive guards:
	‚Ä¢	Treat projects as an array; if not, coerce to [].
	‚Ä¢	If empty, render a clear CTA: ‚ÄúNo projects yet ‚Äî Create Project‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt call .find/.map without verifying the array.
	‚Ä¢	Add a small error boundary around the app shell to keep the UI responsive even if a child throws.

	7.	Lock CORS + cookies

	‚Ä¢	Confirm the server CORS middleware uses your Replit preview host and localhost as allowed origins.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure credentials: true is set in CORS and the client passes cookies on fetch (if your auth flow needs it).
	‚Ä¢	Re-run login + a couple of authenticated calls to confirm no CORS warnings in the console.

	8.	Rate limiting sanity

	‚Ä¢	Ensure public vs. auth vs. heavy limiters are mounted as planned:
	‚Ä¢	/api/auth/* ‚Üí auth limiter
	‚Ä¢	/api/* ‚Üí public limiter
	‚Ä¢	any ‚Äúheavy‚Äù upload/analysis endpoints ‚Üí heavy limiter
	‚Ä¢	Hit each class once to verify you don‚Äôt accidentally throttle normal usage.

‚∏ª

What you (the human) may need to do
	‚Ä¢	Nothing yet, unless the agent asks you to paste a small CORS origin into a config file it cannot edit. If that happens, it should give you the exact block and the exact file path.

‚∏ª

Quick success checks (run these in a second shell)

# 1) Am I logged in? (should 200 with id/email)
curl -sS http://localhost:5001/api/me | jq

# 2) Projects should be an array (even if empty)
curl -sS http://localhost:5001/api/projects | jq type

# 3) Through Vite proxy (should be identical JSON)
curl -sS http://localhost:5175/api/projects | jq type

Expected: string output should be "array" for #2 and #3.

If any of these fail, stop and report the exact error text ‚Äî I‚Äôll give you the next precise fix.

When Step 28 is green, we‚Äôll move to Step 29: Truth Lab E2E (URL/Text ‚Üí analysis job ‚Üí results render, with streaming/polling UX).
