Huge: this confirms the app is actually healthy in Replit’s container. The “HTTP 000” was just our localhost checks poking the wrong network.

Here’s how we lock that in and move forward — clean and correct.

What this means
	•	Use your Replit Preview URL (the worf URL on port 3000) for all health checks from now on.
	•	Localhost :5175/:5001 checks only work inside the same container that’s running the processes (your Preview does; the agent shell often doesn’t).

Next step (safe, no code changes)

Run these smoke checks against your live Preview URL. Replace <YOUR_WORF_URL> with your current address (the one you’re opening at port 3000).

# 1) Basic UI reachable?
curl -sSIL https://<YOUR_WORF_URL>:3000/ | sed -n '1,3p'

# 2) UI -> API proxy health
curl -sS https://<YOUR_WORF_URL>:3000/api/healthz | jq .

# 3) A couple of real API routes (adjust if your auth blocks them)
# Projects list (unauth may 401/403; that’s OK — proves routing)
curl -sSI https://<YOUR_WORF_URL>:3000/api/projects | sed -n '1,5p'

# Truth Lab health (should 200 with a small payload if you mounted it)
curl -sS https://<YOUR_WORF_URL>:3000/api/truth/health | jq .

# 4) Server-side health direct (if you exposed /healthz outside /api)
curl -sS https://<YOUR_WORF_URL>:3000/healthz | jq .

If these return 200 (or 401/403 for protected routes) you’re green.

Then, two quick hardening moves

No code edits needed right now — just process hygiene and a checkpoint:
	1.	Snapshot the good state

git add -A
git commit -m "chore: stable state after Step 34 — Preview URL health OK"
git tag -f step-34-stable
git push && git push --force --tags

	2.	Adopt Preview-first checks going forward
Any time we say “health check,” we’ll target the Preview URL (3000) rather than localhost, unless we explicitly say we’re running inside the same process.

If you want, I can hand you Step 35 next (observability + guardrails: add a /status canary, tiny smoke test script that hits your Preview URL, and a minimal Sentry hook) — all designed the correct way, no hacks, and I’ll clearly separate any human-only edits from agent steps.
