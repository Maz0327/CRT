- ✅ Updated current system status with July 15, 2025 context
- ✅ Added final rate limiting structure with beta-optimized limits
- ✅ Documented cost analysis and safety margins
- ✅ Prepared comprehensive git deployment documentation

## Key Technical Decisions

### Final Rate Limiting Structure
```javascript
// Chat System (Updated July 15, 2025)
chatRateLimit: 50 messages/minute per user
dailyChatRateLimit: 300 messages/day per user

// Analysis System  
openaiRateLimit: 20 requests/minute per user
dailyOpenaiRateLimit: 500 requests/day per user

// General API
generalRateLimit: 200 requests/minute per user (increased for chat support)

// Authentication
authRateLimit: 10 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
```

### Cost Analysis (Final)
- **Analysis Cost**: $0.47/day per user (500 requests × $0.00094)
