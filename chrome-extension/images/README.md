# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for extension toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements:
- PNG format
- Square dimensions
- Clear, recognizable design
- Professional appearance for Chrome Web Store approval

## Temporary Solution:
For testing purposes, you can use any square PNG images with the correct dimensions. For production, create custom icons that match your brand.

## Creating Icons:
1. Design a 128x128 base icon
2. Scale down to create 48x48 and 16x16 versions
3. Ensure icons are clear at all sizes
4. Use tools like Canva, Figma, or Adobe Illustrator
